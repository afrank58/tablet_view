          <p id='about_me'>Hi! My name's Ava and I'm a current junior at the University of Michigan majoring in Information Sciences. 
            I am originally from Larchmont, New York. I'm interested in exploring issues at the intersection of people,
            information, and technology and being able to find creative solutions to problems. 
            Take a look at my various experiences and skills if you'd 
            like to learn more!</p>

      <p id='description'> I'm from Larchmont, New York (about 30 minutes from the city) and attended
        Mamaroneck High School. I've always had a passion for solving problems and 
        creative thinking, two things my Information Science major allows me to 
        further explore. Outside of this, I enjoy exploring new coffee places, going on
        long walks, playing tennis, and spending time with my family and dog! I also 
        enjoy cooking, doing fun art projects, and taking photos of rainbows and pretty
        sunsets which are all shown on this page.
      </p>
      
      <p id='extra_p'>This portfolio wesbite was made for my web design class. It is still a work in 
        progress that is constantly being changed so please excuse any mistakes that have been made!
        I hope it is useful in gaining more insight into the various experiences I have.
      </p>
