      <h3>Skills:</h3>

      <div class="container_skills">
        
        <p id='microsoft_text'>I am proficient in Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel. Most Microsoft products 
          are considered to be office productivity tools. Word is useful for typing various documents and 
          being able to save them. Powerpoint is considered to be a slideshow presentation program and Excel is a 
          software program that enables one to organize, format, and calculate data using a spreadsheet system. I have 
          found all of these tools to be useful, and have had experience applying them in professional settings.
        </p>

        <p id="adobe_text">I am also proficient in Adobe Indesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator. Not only was I exposed
          to these tools in high school through a class, but I have professional experience using these tools 
          through my position as Director of Marketing at Lean In and through my internship at Green Mustache. I am 
          also currently taking SI 320, a graphic design class with an emphasis on UX principles, that has allowed me to 
          further refine and develop these skills. I know how to effectively create visually appealing graphics, edit
          images, and create branded pieces of work.

        <p id='coding'> I have experience using Python and SQL, and have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
          I have been able to learn and practice Python by iterating through data, webscraping, and working 
          on various projects. A project I am most proud of was a team project in which we webscraped data about Michigan
          athletes using Python, analyzed this data to sort it into graphs using SQL, and presented our findings. 
          I am currently taking a web design class, with an emphasis on accessibility, where I have been able to 
          learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript and develop these skills through various projects.
